# Warm-Up-Activities
At SDA & INE

**Project Overview:**

This project is all about working with user data in Python, using dictionaries and lists to organize and manipulate information. The exercises are designed to help you get comfortable with these data structures, so you can easily transform and group user details in various ways. It’s a hands-on way to build up the skills before diving into more complex projects.

### What You’ll Be Doing:

1. **Turning User Info into a Dictionary**:
   - **Function**: `build_user_as_dict(name, email, age)`
   - **What It Does**: Takes basic user details like name, email, and age, and turns them into a neat dictionary format. Think of it as a digital ID card for each user.

2. **Converting Lists to Dictionaries**:
   - **Function**: `transform_user_list_to_dict(a_user)`
   - **What It Does**: Starts with a simple list of user information and transforms it into a dictionary. It’s like organizing scattered notes into a tidy file.

3. **Handling Multiple Users**:
   - **Function**: `transform_multiple_users_to_dicts(multiple_users)`
   - **What It Does**: When you have a bunch of users, this function helps by converting all their data into a list of dictionaries, making it super easy to manage a large group.

4. **Grouping Users by Email Domain**:
   - **Function**: `group_users_by_email_domain(multiple_users)`
   - **What It Does**: This is where things get interesting! It groups users based on their email domain (like gmail.com or hotmail.com), so you can see who’s using what. It’s a great way to organize and analyze your data.

### Why It Matters:

- **Learn by Doing**: This project is a practical way to get comfortable with some core Python skills, especially when it comes to organizing and handling data.
- **Build a Strong Foundation**: By the end, you’ll have a solid grasp on how to structure and transform data—skills that are essential for more advanced projects.
- **Ready for the Next Step**: These exercises set you up perfectly for tackling bigger challenges, like working with football data or other large datasets.

### How to Use It:

- The project comes with built-in tests to make sure everything works as expected.
- It’s a great warm-up for anyone looking to strengthen their Python skills before moving on to more complex tasks.
